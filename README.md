- GET `/notes` - return the `notes.html` file.

- GET `*` - return the `index.html` file

- The application have a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

- GET `/api/notes` - read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

- POST `/api/notes` - receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

- DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - receive a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.
